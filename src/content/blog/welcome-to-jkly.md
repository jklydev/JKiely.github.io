The JKLY site now runs on [Astro](https://astro.build/), a static site framework focused on shipping as little client-side JavaScript as possible. This starter post outlines the structure of the new codebase and shows how easily the content collection system can render long-form writing.

Look in the `src/content/blog/` directory to add more articles. Each entry includes frontmatter for metadata and uses Markdown for the body content. Astro automatically creates pages for these entries and adds them to the RSS feed.
